# Validate Your HTML Markup

## Motivation

To educate the world about the benefits of making sure their HTML/etc. markup
is valid according to the web standards.

## What is valid HTML markup?

Most web browsers will accept various variations in the HTML markup language,
but often will not know exactly what to do unless the markup is well-formed
and strictly abides by the WWW standards. To make it easier for browsers,
for other HTML consumers and processors, and for general good measure, one
should make sure the HTML **validates** and thus is **valid**.
